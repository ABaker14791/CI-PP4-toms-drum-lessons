# Toms Drum Lessons

## Code Institute Portfolio Project 4

Although I am in the process of changing careers, I currently teach 1-1 drum lessons in person. One of the primary reasons I became interested in web development was to build my own website to advertise my business, and host lessons online. This website is aimed at people of all ages who are interested in taking drum lessons with me at my studio, and want to find out a bit more about me and what I can offer, before booking a lesson.

### Strategy Plane

- Site Goal

  - As mentioned above, the site goal is to attract potential customers to take drum lessons.

- Target Audience

  - As lessons are in person, the target audience is primarily people living nearby the studio, as they will need to be physically present during the lessons. As of 2021, there are around 329,000 people living in Wandsworth, London (The borough in which the studio is located). Giving a huge amount of potential customers. This is excluding other adjacent boroughs where current students are happy to travel from, so the actual scale of potential customers is far greater.

- Is there a need for this?

  - As one of the only drum teachers in the surrounding area, the demand for drum teachers far outways the demand. There are currently 4 other teachers in the area, 3 of which do not have a website or significant online presence.

- Is the content relevant?

  - Drumming has been proven to have several health benefits, such as improving problem solving skills, relieving stress and tension, boosting creativity, increasing focus and goal setting through practice, along with generally being a very fun and accessible instrument to learn.

- Customer Needs:

  - At the very least, the customer should know who I am, how to contact me, and where the lessons take place.
  - Further needs can be seen below, with the level of importance and feasability scored.

As the viability score is higher than the importance score, I should in theory be able to implement all of the above features. However that is likely to change once distractions have been accounted for.
